I really enjoyed the refactoring process for this project. All of the reasoning behind the steps and process was very logical, making it easy to agree with. My only issue was with how small the increments of refactoring were, however this is a personal issue and not a process issue. I like to achieve large chunks of work at once, and struggle to break things up into smaller pieces although it helps me. I will have to pay close attention to make sure I am not doing too many things at once, and that I do not wear multiple hats at once.
